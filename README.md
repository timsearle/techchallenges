# Technical Challenges
This repository contains all technical challenges that I have completed recently, either for job/contract processes or for fun!

The company names or the instructions associated with the challenge and API keys have not been included but any pertinent constraints that were imposed for the challenge and the date I did them are mentioned.

Personally I am not a big fan of the technical challenge approach to interview processes, I believe the balance of effort given in completing the challenge rarely balances with what is gained in return. But hopefully I can gain (and share) more value by publishing my efforts here!

If I am asked to produce a technical challenge, I will endeavour always to share here!

## LastFM

Create an application that interacts with parts of the LastFM API. Constraints/requirements were it needed to be written in Swift 4 and had to have unit tests, third-party library usage was optional - I decided to utilise [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for image caching and a networking (among other features) framework I helped author at my current company, [Base](https://github.com/niceagency/Base). Time spent 8~ hours. February 2018.

## TubeMapper

Create a nearby arrivals application, consuming London Underground data from the TfL Unified API. Constraints were it had to use Objective-C. Time spent 10~ hours. November 2017.
